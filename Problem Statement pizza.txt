Problem Statement
I need to analyze critical indicators for pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance. Specifically, I want to calculate the following metrics.

KPI
1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizza Sold: The sum of quantities of all pizza sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, is calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

Charts Requirement
I want to visualize various aspects of pizza sales data to gain insight and understand key trends. I have identified the following requirement for creating charts:
1. Daily Trend for Total Orders:
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific period. This chart will help us identify any patterns of fluctuations in order volumes daily.
2. Hourly Trend for Total Orders:
Create a line chart illustrating the daily hourly trend of total orders. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high-order activity.
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:
Create a pie chart showing sales distribution across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insight into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4. Percentage of Sales Pizza Size:
Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:
Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by total Pizzas Sold:
Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total number sold. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.
7. Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:
Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.


After analyzing with SQL. I will try to visualize it by using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard that I created can provide important insights for business interests. Here is a google drive link that contains the project file I am working on. Thanks
